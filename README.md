This project contains a TIA Portal file for the PLC control as well as 3 Arduino files

One Arduino file is meant for converting the date from a I2C sensor to an analog signal.
The two other Arduino files are meant for converting an analog voltage signal into a PWM signal for a motorcontroller. There is one for the front actuators and one for the back ones.
